  A master works within the eternal Tao, not within the rising and

  Realize that the world we inhabit day by day is temporary.

It is tempting to think that the way we describe the world is natural.
This things is yellow, that one is red. This is heavy, that is light.
This is beautiful, that is ugly. That is evil, this is good.

No matter how natural such descriptions might seem, they are not of nature:
they are of us. They are our attempts to categorize the ten thousands things
so that we might understand them. But the ten thousand things are but passing
forms; here one moment, gone the next. And our understanding of such things
is no less fleeting.

There are no absolutes in nature. Nothing is ever fully one thing to the
exclusion of its opposite. Within the deepest night lies the promise of dawn,
within the brightest summer the seeds of winter. To think of things in
absolutes is the wrong perspective.

To think in terms of difficult or easy, high or low, before or after, 
is to lock your way of thinking, of seeing things, into the world
of the ten thousand things. When you detach yourself from that passing world
and make your thoughts one with the Tao, such distinctions become
meaningless. In such a state, you can observe the dance of the passing
ten thousand things without being affected. As Mitchell puts it:

> Things arise and she lets them come; things disappear and she lets them go.

The master, always present in this state, doesn't interact directly
with the passing world as most of us do. They move within the Tao,
and action in the temporal plane flows from that. Thus, though the master
might be teaching, they are not really speaking: they teach within the Tao,
and words are uttered within this world as a consequence. Though the master
may hold one of the ten thousand things, they know it to be fleeting
and don't hold on to it.

[Lin translated the final lesson of this chapter thus](http://www.taoism.net/ttc/chapters/chap02.htm):

> They succeed but do not dwell on success<br>
  It is because they do not dwell on success<br>
  That it never goes away

Because the master acts within the eternal Tao, their actions have
true meaning. They do not dwell on passing glory.
And yet, because they are not concerned with it, succes follows
their every action.
